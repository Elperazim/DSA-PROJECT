# DSA-PROJECT
### A detailed lowdown on my DSA projects
This is a breakdown, interpretation and screenshots of the Power Bi project I worked on.

The name of the comany is PALMORIA GROUP - a manufacturing company with branches in Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna, with a staff strength of 946 staff. The company is facing a media backlash bordering on Gender inequality, siting that the group prefers the male gender to others and this view can seriously harm the prospects of the company, especially if they are lookig to expand beyond Nigeria. As an HR Analytics expert, I've been tasked with solving the 'gender inequality' problem and providing insights on how the company can solve this issue and make recommendations where necesary. The job is to look at the inconsistencies in gender and other areas that needs attention, and make necessary recommendation.

After looking at the data set, it was clear that there were some inconsistencies that needed to be corrected i.e taking out the NULL departments, and grouping the staff with undisclosed gender, getting additional information so that I can interprete the data more correctly.

Having gotten all required information, the first task is to determine the gender distribution in various department and accross each state. And statistics from various department shows that the male gender dominate more than the female gender and the unspecified gender. This is also visible in the number staff (gender) in the company as we see the male gender with a 49.1% population, closely followed by the female with 46.6% and the unspecified gender making up the rest od the population.

The next task is to get information on ratings based on gender. From the representation, we see that 

The next task is get the salary sturcture and gender paygap, and we see that across all branches and dpartments, there is a pay gap of 3.5% in favor of the male gender.

A new regulation mandating companies to pay its staff a minimum of $90,000 was enacted, and from the analysis, it is evident that Palmora Group does not meet this criteria as only 292 staff recieve the minimum salary (and above) out of a total staff strength of 946, while 654 staff are paid below. Regionally, Kaduna (250) has the highest number of staff that are paid below the minimum salary, followed by Abuja(238), and Lastly, Lagos with 166. 

Futhermore, Plamora Group has asked that i calculate the amount of bonus to be paid to individual employee, the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary + bonus), and total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.

From the analysis carried out, we see the amount of bonus to be paid to individual employee, we also see the that the total amount to be paid (salary + bonus) is $71,922,949.3, while the the total amount to be paid per rigion is $1.03m. State wise, Kaduna has the highest amount of bonus with $825,000 followed by Abuja with $801,000 and Lagos with $572,000.
The gender with the highest bonus pay in Kaduna is the male gender, in Abuja, the female gender dominates, same as Lagos state.
