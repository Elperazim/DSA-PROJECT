# DSA-PROJECT
A detailed lowdown on my DSA projects
This is a breakdown, interpretation and screenshots of the Power Bi project I worked on.
After looking at the data set, it was clear that there were some inconsistencies that needed to be corrected i.e taking out the NULL departments, and grouping the staff with undisclosed gender.
The company staff strength is fairly large and has brances in LAgos, Abuja and Kaduna.
The first task to solve is the gender distribution in various department and accross each state.
